        "description": "As a Backend Software Engineering Intern at The Difference, I gained significant experience designing and optimizing MySQL databases. I implemented a new normalized schema that reduced data duplication by 18 percent across 8 core tables. To deliver a macro nutrition tracking feature by the deadline, I led a cross functional team to develop and launch that capability. My optimizations included building an aggregated results table that cut report generation time from two minutes to just five seconds. One major component involved migrating legacy data from 5 key tables into the new schema with 0 percent data loss. By crafting optimized INSERT and UPDATE queries, I improved the food table's performance by 22 percent whilst lowering storage by removing 10 unused columns. Additionally, I developed a highly requested routines table that enabled users to build customized workout plans with linked steps. I presented ERD diagrams and proposals to the CTO, directly influencing the future product roadmap. Through these database optimization, migration, and development initiatives, I made significant contributions in database performance, legacy system analysis, and new feature developments."

Through this mentorship, I gained insider knowledge of Google's engineering culture, learning about company perks, business units, hiring practices and techniques for succeeding in their unique interview process. I built strong connections with Google employees while significantly expanding my own technical abilities and interview preparation through tackling challenging problems and receiving guidance from my mentor. The program provided me with invaluable insights and hands-on experience that helped fast-track my development as a software engineer. I acquired highly relevant skills and made impactful networking connections that continue to benefit my career growth."
